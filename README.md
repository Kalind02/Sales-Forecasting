#Sales Forecasting

# Introduction
In this project, we are trying to forecasts product sales.
For this particular problem, we have analyzed the data as a supervised learning problem. In order to
forecasts the sales we have compared different regression models like Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Decision Tree, ExtraTreeRegressor, Random Forest and LGBM Regressor. Further to optimize the results we
have used multilayer perception (MLP: a class of feed forward artificial neural network) and LightGBM (
gradient boosting framework that uses tree based learning algorithms).
